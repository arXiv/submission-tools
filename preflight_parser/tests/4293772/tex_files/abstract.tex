% what problem are we solving and why is it important
System Level Synthesis (SLS) allows us to construct internally stabilizing controllers for large-scale systems. However, solving large-scale SLS problems is computationally expensive and the state-of-the-art methods consider only state feedback; 
output feedback poses additional challenges because the constraints are no longer uniquely row or column separable.

We exploit the structure of the output-feedback SLS problem by vectorizing the multi-sided matrix multiplications in the SLS optimization constraints, which allows us to reformulate it as a discrete-time control problem and solve using two stages of dynamic programming (DP). Additionally, we derive an approximation algorithm that offers a faster runtime 
by partially enforcing the constraints, and show that this algorithm offers the same results. DP solves SLS up to $7$ times faster, with an additional $42\%$ to $68\%$ 
improvement using the approximation algorithm, than a convex program solver, and scales with large state dimensions %state, input, output} 
and finite impulse response horizon.

% The abstract could be more precisely written, e.g., “the constraints have a more complex form”
% is vague and what do you mean by “scales with large state, input, output...”?
