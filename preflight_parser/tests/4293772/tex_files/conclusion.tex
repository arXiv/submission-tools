\section{Conclusion}\label{sec:conclusion}
We derived DP algorithms to solve output-feedback SLS problems by reformulating the optimization constraints as a linear control problem,
using two stages of DP to enforce boundary conditions and an interior condition. We illustrated specific examples of our DP algorithm on the $\mathcal{H}_2$ and quadratic objectives,
along with computation time results of each. The simulation results show that DP, including the approximation DP, outperforms the traditional CVX solver. 
Future work includes deriving either deterministic or probabilistic guarantees for when the approximation algorithm converges, given broader classes of systems beyond 
stochastic chains. Additionally, we want to investigate the robustness of this method to model uncertainty.
