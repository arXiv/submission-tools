abstract = {Autonomous agents are software programs which respond to states and events in their environment independent from direct instruction by the user or owner of the agent, but acting on behalf and in the interest of the owner. The term agent is not defined precisely, and agent software can range from simple programs composed of a small number of rules to large and complex systems. Agent technology was developed in artificial intelligence (AI) research, and can include complex AI techniques. Important application areas are those where the human user can benefit from continuous data analysis, monitoring of data streams and large databases, and where routine reactions to events are required. Many applications are related to user interface technology and the Internet. A weak position sees agents as tools which relieve humans from routine tasks suited to computational solutions, but there is also a strong position which asserts that agents can be constructed to mimic or even surpass cognitive functions of the human.}

abstract = {Believable proxies of human behavior can empower interactive applications ranging from immersive environments to rehearsal spaces for interpersonal communication to prototyping tools. In this paper, we introduce generative agents: computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent’s experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty-five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors. For example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine’s Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture—observation, planning, and reflection—each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},
